🐺  Heads up: 🐺 

🔍 We conducted our own internal audit this week.  Our fixes have been pushed out to the repos. 🔍 

🔒 Now that the audit has begun in earnest, we have locked the Audit repo to the 'gold' commit. 🔒

The links in the repo are now permalinks so there will be no more changes!

Thanks for your patience, and good luck!

Good morning wardens!  We discovered a few variables hadn't been renamed in the `v4-timelocks` repo.  We've pushed a change to make it consistent with `v4-core`. 

The Contest Repo's permalinks have been updated.  No more changes after this!  🤝 

We've also noticed a number of typos and inconsistencies in the v4 documentation: <https://v4.docs.pooltogether.com>.  These have now been fixed- but if you spot anything else let us know!

🐺  Hello again wolfpack! 🐺 

This week you'll looking at our new TwabRewards contract.  This contract rewards ticket holders with incentives, but holders don't need to stake!  The TwabReward contract can measure a ticket holder's share of liquidity thanks to the TWAB <https://dev.pooltogether.com/protocol/concepts/time-weight-average-balance>

We'll also have a new sponsor from whom you can ask questions: @Pierrick!  Ask either of us any questions you have.

🗨️  Feel free to dm us, whether through Discord or email: brendan@pooltogether.com.

@🐺wardens The **PoolTogether TwabRewards** contest is now closed! Huge thanks to everyone who participated🔍, whether you submitted a finding or not.

What's next: the PoolTogether team will review the findings over the next couple of days, and then we'll pass them off to the judge. Keep an eye on #📢announcements for regular updates on how the contest is progressing through awarding 🤑🏆, judging 🧑‍⚖️ and reporting 📜. Feel free to ping an organizer if you have questions along the way!

Totally random question @Brendan 🌊🏆 but do you feel like TWAB would save you gas over accruing user points each time their balance changes?


[12/13/2021 4:43 PM] asselstine
> Totally random question @Brendan 🌊🏆 but do you feel like TWAB would save you gas over accruing user points each time their balance changes?
@Alex The Entreprenerd  are you saying points in lieu of the twab?

Points you’d have to claim then deposit for each prize period.  So I think overall it would be cheaper gas, but the TWAB alone adds 50-90k gas for a token transfer.


[12/13/2021 4:44 PM] asselstine
So if you’re considering individual transfers the TWAB will be more expensive than many things


[12/13/2021 4:45 PM] asselstine
You’d need to fully clarify the use case to determine what mechanism supports the feature most efficiently


[12/13/2021 5:27 PM] alextheentreprenerd
I'm thinking of a similar use-case as yours
We give point over time based on share ownership
After X time we know how many rewards to distribute
We can then calculate the points (shares * time) to know how to distribute


[12/13/2021 5:27 PM] alextheentreprenerd
We would use it to distribute non-want tokens on vaults (extra tokens fairly distributed)


[12/13/2021 5:53 PM] asselstine
Ah


[12/13/2021 5:53 PM] asselstine
Yes it fits that use case perfectly


[12/13/2021 5:54 PM] asselstine
The only thing it doesn't do is compounding.  Compounding is kind of faked, anyhow, in most contracts


[12/13/2021 5:55 PM] asselstine
The other advantage of the TWAB is that users don't need to explicitly stake.  You just create a new "promotion" on the TWAB and drop tokens


[12/13/2021 5:55 PM] asselstine
You can drop more than one token too; as many as you want


[12/13/2021 5:55 PM] asselstine
Then users just claim when they want to pull tokens out


[12/13/2021 6:37 PM] alextheentreprenerd
Sounds great, will look into it!

🐺  Hello again wolfpack! 🐺 

This week you'll looking at TWAB Delegation contract.  This contract will allow users to delegate a *portion* of their tickets to another user. This will be an important building block for PT V4 ticket derivatives.

@Brendan 🌊🏆 what's the purpose of having time locks on delegations ?


[02/24/2022 9:40 PM] asselstine
@Pedroais So that the delegatee has a guarantee that the delegation will last a minimum length of time


[02/24/2022 9:43 PM] pedroais
Makes sense

Hi, i send my finding for gas optimization and QA separately 2.5 hours ago.  For gas optimization i received an submissions email after 1 hour, but not for QA Report. Could you tell me if my QA report reached the team or not?
